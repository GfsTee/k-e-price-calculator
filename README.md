This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What was this project?

The goal was to create a app, where you can put in prices for art and frames.  
Calculate the taxes and if you give your customers a discount it calculates the new prices.  
Discounts only apply to the art. Not the frames.  
You can add more sets to it.
Styling is still a to do but it now is functioning as planned :-D
